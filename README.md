# Comprehensive Guide to Neural Networks
Summer 2025 built for a more personalized experience working with neural networks, helps build understanding surrounding the math and complexity behind the model. Please keep in mind that this project is intended to give beginners a rundown of the important aspects of a neural network, and will not cover variations like liquid networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, or etc, nor will this guide cover advance practices either.A simple model is built and tested on a set of pixelized numbers to identify between 1s and 5s
## Features
The data folder includes both the testing and training data after feature transformation was performed:
- Average intensity of for each grid where 5s will have higher intensity while 1s while have lower intensity. 
- Symmetry between the top half of the number and the bottom half of the number.
# Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that anyone can use and build. It is inspired by the human brain and can be used to understanding patterns through processing data. They are typically used in fields such as image or natural language processing.
## Structure
The most basic component of a neural network is called a node or a neuron(inspired cells in the human brain) and it pocesses the ability to recieve and pass along information.
